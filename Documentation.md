# Data Protection Strategy Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive data protection strategy leveraging AWS services to ensure secure data management, encryption, and access control across the cloud infrastructure.

## Architecture Components

### 1. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
- **Purpose**: Provides SSL/TLS certificates for secure data in transit
- **Implementation**:
  - Deploy ACM to manage and provision certificates
  - Automate certificate renewal
  - Integrate with other AWS services for encrypted connections

### 2. Amazon Route 53
- **Purpose**: Secure DNS service with DNSSEC capabilities
- **Implementation**:
  - Configure DNS routing with health checks
  - Implement DNSSEC for DNS query authentication
  - Route traffic to protected endpoints

### 3. Gateway Protection Layer
- **Components**:
  - **Network Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic with TLS termination
  - **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Hosts containerized applications with security groups
  - **Amazon S3**: Secure storage with encryption and access policies

### 4. Data Encryption Services
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:
  - Centralized encryption key management
  - Customer Master Key (CMK) rotation policies
  - Integration with other AWS services for data encryption
- **AWS Secrets Manager**:
  - Secure storage of database credentials, API keys
  - Automatic rotation of secrets
  - Fine-grained access control

### 5. Compute Protection
- **Amazon EC2**:
  - Instance-level security groups and NACLs
  - Encrypted EBS volumes using KMS
  - Systems Manager for patching and compliance
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**:
  - Secured container orchestration
  - Pod security policies
  - Network encryption between pods

## Data Protection Controls

### Data in Transit
- All external communications protected with ACM certificates
- TLS 1.2+ enforced across all services
- Route 53 DNSSEC for DNS query protection

### Data at Rest
- S3 buckets configured with default encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- EBS volumes encrypted with KMS keys
- Secrets Manager for credential storage with encryption

### Access Control
- IAM policies with least privilege principle
- Secrets Manager for credential management
- KMS key policies for encryption access

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation**:
   - Deploy ACM for all public-facing services
   - Configure Route 53 with DNSSEC
   - Implement KMS with initial key policies

2. **Phase 2 - Data Protection**:
   - Enable default encryption for all S3 buckets
   - Configure EBS encryption for all EC2 instances
   - Migrate secrets to Secrets Manager

3. **Phase 3 - Advanced Controls**:
   - Implement certificate auto-rotation
   - Configure secret auto-rotation
   - Establish KMS key rotation schedule

## Monitoring and Compliance

- AWS Config for continuous compliance monitoring
- Prometheus and grafana for proper monitoring and logging
- Regular audits of KMS key usage and IAM policies

## Maintenance

- Quarterly review of all encryption keys and certificates
- Biannual access control reviews
- Continuous vulnerability scanning of EC2 instances and containers
